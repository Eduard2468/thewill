    <H1>Romans 6</H1>

        <p>Romans 6:4-7 when we take baptism our sin dies with our body and we are no longer ruled by the flesh.</p>
        <p>Romans 6:11-14 if you let sin dwell in you evil will be your master, but if you give yourself to Christ you can rule over sin and be used for rightousness by God, for God.</p>
        <p>Because of Gods grace we are no longer slaves to sin, and if you chose to be rightous you be holy and have eternal life.</p>
